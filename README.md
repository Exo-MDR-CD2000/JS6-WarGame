# JS6-WarGame
A game of war in browser console

## Description

The goal was to recreate the game War using Javascript OOP concepts and then have the game be played out automatically in the broswer console. The rules are a modified version of game with the following rules below:

1. Deal 26 Cards to each Player from a Deck of 52 cards.
2. Iterate through the turns where each Player plays a Card.
3. The Player who played the higher card is awarded a point.
    - Ties result in zero points for both Players.
4. After all cards have been played, display the score and declare the winner.

Jokers are not included in the deck and the values go from 2-14.
